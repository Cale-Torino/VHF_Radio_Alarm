# VHF Radio Alarm

RDC TX-5000 (aka TX5 Old)

Uses **SABRE** frequencies for alarm systems **VHF** `140.5 - 141.0` & **VHF** `152.05 - 152.5`

This particular version uses 12v and has 4 outputs for triggering sensors.

It also has a linear power supply using a 7812A JRC for charging a 12v 7A battery.

This power supply is a bit dangerous since it will get stressed from charging a flat battery.

It also has close proximity between mains live in, neutral in in and ground...
